PDF Diff
===========

Extracts plain text from pdfs and then compares their differences using FileMerge (requires dev tools to be installed). Rudimentary 5-minute implementation. Making it nicer to use, win prizes.

An executable app and the Automator script are both provided here.

Use: It will ask the user to select the first PDF file, then after that the 2nd PDF, and then it will open FileMerge showing the diff between them. (If there are no differences nothing happens, but it's not (necessarily) broken.)
